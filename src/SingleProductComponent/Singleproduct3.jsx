            <p className=' mb-4 text-[gray]'>Embodying the raw, wayward spirit of rock 'n' roll, the killburn portable active stereo speakers takes the unmistakable look and <br /> sound of marshall, unplug the chords, and takes the show on the road.</p>
            <p className=' text-[gray]'>Weighing in under 7 pounds, the killburn is a lightweight piece of intage styled engineering. Setting the bar as on of the loudest <br />
            speakers in its class, the killburn is a compact, stout-hearted hero with a well balanced audio which boasts a clear midrange <br />
            and extended highs for a sound that is both articulated and pronounced. The analogue knob allows you to fine tunes the controls <br />
            to your personal preference while the guitar-influenced leather strap enables easy and stylish travel. </p>
